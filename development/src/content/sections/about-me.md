![](/media/DSC_0287_2.jpg)

I am a recent graduate of UNC Greensboro with a degree in Social Media Marketing. I realized I loved marketing after taking over my club’s socials and had a blast bringing it to life in the esports field. Since then, I’ve been hooked on creating content, telling stories, and finding new ways to connect with people.

Through my experience, I’ve become comfortable using tools like Canva, Affinity Designer, and data tools to research market segments and demographic trends. I am also passionate about learning and growing my skillset to tell a story and bring people together.
