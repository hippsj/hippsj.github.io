For this project, I analyzed Topgolf at Greensboro’s customer experience, audience segments, and promotional opportunities to create a targeted marketing strategy.

**Research & Analysis:**
- Studied Topgolf’s peak and off-peak times to identify opportunities of growth.
- Reviewed positive and negative customer reviews to understand what drives satisfaction and where there were areas of improvement.
- Developed four strategic suggestions to improve engagement and strengthen customer experience.

**Customer Segmentation:**
- Identified 14 potential customer segments based on demographics, lifestyle, and interests.
- Selected two priority segments to bring engagement within different demographics and lifestyles.

**Campaign Development:**
- Designed engaging promotional materials in Canva, customized for each target segment and optimized for both print and digital platforms.
- Used Data Axle to analyze local area demographics and Every Door Direct Mail to identify carrier routes best suited for the Topgolf promotion.

**Conclusion**
This case study highlights my ability to combine **data analysis, audience insights**, and **creative design** to develop promotional ideas that **support business goal** and **increase engagement** during slower time periods.
