# Typography Showcase

This section demonstrates various text styles and formatting options available in the portfolio. It serves as a test for basic typography rendering.

## Text Variations

Here is a paragraph with **bold text**, _italic text_, and _**bold italic text**_. We can also use ~strikethrough~ to indicate deleted content or `inline code` for technical terms.

# Lists Demonstration

Lists are essential for organizing information. Here we explore different list styles and nesting capabilities.

## Unordered Lists

*   **Primary Item 1**: The first point of interest.
*   **Primary Item 2**: Another key point.
    *   _Secondary Item A_: A sub-point with italic emphasis.
    *   _Secondary Item B_: Another sub-point.
        *   Tertiary Item i: Deeply nested item.
        *   Tertiary Item ii: Another deep item.
*   **Primary Item 3**: The final main point.

## Ordered Lists

1.  **Step One**: Initialize the process.
2.  **Step Two**: Configure the settings.
    1.  Select the desired options.
    2.  Confirm the selection.

# Quotes & Blocks

This final section tests how blockquotes and code blocks interact with the layout, ensuring they are readable and distinct.

## Blockquotes

> The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a standard blockquote used to highlight important text or citations.
> 
> It can span multiple paragraphs to provide more context or a longer excerpt from a source.

## Code Blocks

Here is a simple Javascript snippet:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet("World");
```

And a CSS snippet:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
