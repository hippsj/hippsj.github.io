This proposal focused on helping local makeup artist, Flora Zamora, establish a strong foundation for growth in North Carolina, specifically the Triad area. I worked with a team of three in bringing this proposal to life with industry research, marketing strategy and mix, and social media posts.

For the proposal, I conducted an in-depth industry trend and customer analysis to guide brand positioning and service offerings. By analyzing data from Mintel and IBISWorld data, I uncovered that over 88% of women ages 18-54 years old regularly wear makeup, which showcased a strong demand for makeup services. I identified new growth opportunities, such as teen event makeup and inclusive services for men. 

Using Data Axle and SimplyAnalytics, I developed detailed customer segments, including brides, professionals, pageant moms, and nightlife enthusiasts. Each group had unique beauty motivations, spending habits, and event needs, which helped shape Flora’s pricing, promotions, and social media direction.

This project showcased my ability to turn **data into creative strategy** to connect audience insights with brand storytelling to help a small business grow visibility and bookings both online and locally.
