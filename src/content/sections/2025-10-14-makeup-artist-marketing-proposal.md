|     | Working closely with my team, I contributed to shaping the **branding and marketing mix**, ensuring our ideas reflected Floraâ€™s elegant, modern identity. |     |
| I helped design **social media posts and signage** with **Canva** to bring our strategy to life visually. The final proposal gave Flora Makeup Studio a clear path to strengthen its brand presence and connect authentically with its community. |     |     |
