For this project, I analyzed Topgolf at Greensboro’s customer experience, audience segments, and promotional opportunities to create a targeted marketing strategy. 

**Research & Analysis:** 

*   Studied Topgolf’s peak and off-peak times to identify opportunities of growth. 
    
*   Reviewed positive and negative customer reviews to understand what drives satisfaction and where there were areas of improvement. 
    
*   Developed four strategic suggestions to improve engagement and strengthen customer experience.
    

**Customer Segmentation:** 

*   Identified 14 potential customer segments based on demographics, lifestyle, and interests. 
    
*   Selected two priority segments to bring engagement within different demographics and lifestyles.
    

**Campaign Development:** 

*   Designed engaging promotional materials in Canva, customized for each target segment and optimized for both print and digital platforms.
    
*   Used Data Axle to analyze local area demographics and Every Door Direct Mail to identify carrier routes best suited for the Topgolf promotion.
    

**Conclusion**

This case study highlights my ability to combine **data analysis, audience insights**, and **creative design** to develop promotional ideas that **support business goal** and **increase engagement** during slower time periods.
